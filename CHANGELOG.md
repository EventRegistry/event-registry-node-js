# NodeJS SDK: Change Log

This log contains changes specific to the NodeJS SDK.
## [v8.10.2]() (2022-05-09)
- Correctly exposed internal types and move other types to development dependencies. Thanks to the PR vorant94/master#17

## [v8.10.1]() (2022-03-23)

**Breaking**

- `TopicPage.getArticles` and `TopicPage.getEvents` return full response with additional page/pages information (instead of simple array of articles/events).

## [v8.10.0]() (2021-10-19)

**Added**

- added file `QueryMentions` that can be used to query mentions of specific event types. The class is currently in beta and not available to users unless they have permissions to use this endpoint. The classes `QueryMentions` and `QueryMentionsIter` can be used in the same way as classes for querying articles and events, except that some query parameters are added and some removed. Examples for the classes were also added.

**Updated**
- When using method `initWithComplexQuery` we now check if the provided json is valid json object and report error in case it is not

## [v8.9.2]() (2021-05-12)

**Updated**

- Updated dependencies of the SDK library

## [v8.9]() (2020-11-24)

**Added**

- added `required` and `excluded` optional parameters to the TopicPage class to methods `addConcept`, `addKeyword`, `addCategory`, `addSource`, `addSourceLocation` and `addSourceGroup`.
- exceptions are now raised by the SDK library in case of status codes 204, 400, 401, 403 and 530. The meaning of the above status codes is described on the [documentation page](https://eventregistry.org/documentation?tab=introduction).

## [v8.8.0]() (2020-10-07)

**Added**

- added filters `reportingDateStart` and `reportingDateEnd` to `QueryEvents`. You can use these dates to find the events where the average date of reporting matches this date range. Note that `dateStart` and `dateEnd` will return events based on when they (supposedly) happened and it can be quite different than the reporting dates.
- added parameters `updatesAfterNewsUri`, `updatesafterBlogUri`, `updatesAfterPrUri` to the `RequestArticlesRecentActivity`. Can be used to make sure that absolutely no article is missed when using the `QueryArticles` with `RequestArticlesRecentActivity` requested result. See [this file](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-node-js/blob/master/examples/feedOfNewArticlesExamples.ts) for an example of use.


## [v8.7.0]() (2020-01-31)

**Added**
- added `EventRegistry.getServiceStatus()` method that reports status of the services
- We added sentiment, which can now be used in querying of articles and events. The `QueryArticles`, `QueryArticlesIter`, `QueryEvents`, `QueryEventsIter` now all have additional parameters `minSentiment` and `maxSentiment` that can be used to filter the articles and events. The valid values are between -1 (very negative sentiment) and 1 (very positive sentiment). Value 0 represents neutral sentiment.
- Sentiment was also added as a property in the returned articles and events.
- `ComplexQueryArticles` and `ComplexQueryEvents` classes now support in the constructor additional filters like `minSentiment`, `maxSentiment`, `minFacebookShares`, `endSourceRankPercentile`, etc.

**Updated**
- `ReturnInfo` classes (`ArticleInfoFlags`, `ConceptInfoFlags`, ...) were updated. Some obsolete parameters were removed and we've also added support to directly pass any rarely used parameters, that are not a part of the typings.
- `TopicPage.getArticles` and `TopicPage.getEvents` methods now also support passing any rarely used parameters directly, that are not a part of the typings.
- Analytics: We updated `trainTopicOnTweets()`, `trainTopicClearTopic()` and `trainTopicGetTrainedTopic()` methods in the `Analytics` class.
- `Analytics.annotate()` method now supports passing custom parameters that should be used when annotating the text.
- Changed some defaults in the returned data. When searching articles, we now by default return article image and sentiment.
- Analytics. updated `trainTopicOnTweets()`, `trainTopicClearTopic()` and `trainTopicGetTrainedTopic()` methods in the `Analytics` class.
- `QueryArticles.initWithComplexQuery()` was updated - the parameter `dataType` was removed (since the `dataType` value should be provided in the `$filter` section of the query)
- `TopicPage` now supports setting also the source rank percentile
- `Analytics.extractArticleInfo` now also supports setting the headers and cookies to be used when making the requests

**Removed**

- removed `EventRegistry.suggestCustomConcepts()` and `EventRegistry.getCustomConceptUri()` methods. Not used anymore since we are not supporting anymore the correlation feature.

## [v8.5.13]() (2018-10-10)

**Changed**
- Better exposure of Typescript type definitions (affects Typescript users)

## [v8.5.1]() (2018-09-17)

**Changed**
- A couple of minor fixes and improvements for examples and other minor things

## [v8.5.0]() (2018-09-14)

**Added**
- Added `Analytics.trainTopicOnTweets()` method that can be used to train a topic by analyzing a group of tweets. See example of usage on the [wiki page](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python/wiki/Text-analytics#train-a-topic-based-on-the-tweets).
- Added a group of `Analytics.trainTopic*()` methods that can be used to analyze your own documents and build a topic from them. See example of usage on the [wiki page](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python/wiki/Text-analytics#train-a-custom-topic).

## [v8.4.0]() (2018-09-13)

**Added**
- added searching of articles and events based on article authors. You can now provide `authorUri` parameter when creating the `QueryArticles` and `QueryEvents` instances.
- added author related methods to `EventRegistry` class: `EventRegistry.suggestAuthors()` to obtain uris of authors for given (partial) name and `EventRegistry.getAuthorUri()` to obtain a single author uri for the given (partial) name.
- added ability to search articles and events by authors. `QueryArticles` and `QueryEvents` constructors now also accept `authorUri` parameter that can be used to limit the results to articles/events by those authors. Use `QueryOper.AND()` or `QueryOper.OR()` to specify multiple authors in the same query.
- BETA: added a filter for returning only articles that are written by sources that have a certain ranking. The filter can be specified by setting the parameters `startSourceRankPercentile` and `endSourceRankPercentile` when creating the `QueryArticles` instance. The default value for `startSourceRankPercentile` is 0 and for `endSourceRankPercentile` is 100. The values that can be set are not any value between 0 and 100 but has to be a number divisible by 10. By setting `startSourceRankPercentile` to 0 and `endSourceRankPercentile` to 20 you would get only articles from top ranked news sources (according to [Alexa site ranking](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo)) that would amount to about *approximately 20%* of all matching content. Note: 20 percentiles do not represent 20% of all top sources. The value is used to identify the subset of news sources that generate approximately 20% of our collected news content. The reason for this choice is that top ranked 10% of news sources writes about 30% of all news content and our choice normalizes this effect. This feature could potentially change in the future.
- `QueryEventArticlesIter` is now able to return only a subset of articles assigned to an event. You can use the same filters as with the `QueryArticles` constructor and you can specify them when constructing the instance of `QueryEventArticlesIter`. The same kind of filtering is also possible if you want to use the `RequestEventArticles()` class instead.
- added some parameters and changed default values in some of the result types to reflect the backend changes.
- added optional parameter `proxyUrl` to `Analytics.extractArticleInfo()`. It can be used to download article info through a proxy that you provide (to avoid potential GDPR issues). The `proxyUrl` should be in format `{schema}://{username}:{pass}@{proxy url/ip}`.

## [v8.3.12]() (2018-08-16)

**Added**
- Added `getUsageInfo` method which returns usage information. It returns an object with two properties: availableTokens and usedTokens

## [v8.3.11]() (2018-08-13)

**Added**
- Missing utility methods`getRemainingAvailableRequests`, `getDailyAvailableRequests`, `getLastHeaders` and `getLastHeader`.

## [v8.3.1]() (2018-08-06)

**Changed**
- Switched to POST requests instead of GET

## [v8.3.0]() (2018-08-06)

**Added**
 - Implemented all the latest changes as seen in the Python SDK 8.3.0.

**Breaking**
- `QueryArticlesIter`, `QueryEventArticlesIter` and `QueryEventsIter` now return one item at a time instead of the whole page (array) of items.

**Changed**
- Updated to Typescript 3.0.
- Version bump to be more inline with the Python SDK versioning
- It's no longer possible to specify batch sizes for `QueryArticlesIter`, `QueryEventArticlesIter` and `QueryEventsIter`.
